            <h3>A dream that human beings and robots could live together.<br><br></h3>
            <section class="imgandtext" id="ideal">
                <p>Toby's Dream Land was founded in 1993. Although the residents of the entire city are now robots, the foundation of everything was established by a human, Dr. Chang, who is also as known
                as our father. The doctor's dream is to let robots with artificial intelligence help humans solve problems, thus eliminating the distrust of robots in human society, and living peacefully with each other eventually.<br>
                <br>After nearly 20 years of observation and preparation, we finally started offering the first experimental activity in 2017, which is to help children with ADHD to enhance their ability of self-control with non-medical treatment and provide a comfortable environment for them to improvise their creativity. Now, formal edition is ready to launch.

                <p>Po Chun Chang was born in 1958. He graduated from NTU(National Taiwan University) with a dual Ph.D. in mathematics and electrical engineering. He exhibited amazing mathematical talents and an interest in machinery at an early age. Before he went to college, he had achieved outstanding results in several high-intensity robot competitions.
                     And he was also the only one in school history to get a double doctoral degree before the age of 25.<br><br>
                     After graduating, he established a robot research and development company with his friends. But unfortunately, one of them stole almost all the funds from that company.  However, He did not feel discouraged but continued to research in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics, but unlike the previous ones, the staffs were not humans, but the artificial intelligence developed by him, and because of this, the achievements have advanced by leaps and bounds. In 1993, to prevent the misuse of his robots, the doctor built a piece of a floating island floating and lived with his robots.

                <p>Although the first event only lasted two years from 2017 to 2019, we had achieved quite an outstanding achievement. In a team with only six children, they won a world-class award this year.<br><br>
                Pan is a 10-year-old child but with amazing creativity. He canâ€™t concentrate on school education. Through filming and tailoring education on our island, he is now able to "focus" on his interest and school works. The cartoon script he created, through the cooperation with five other partners, presented the story in a novel and special way. This film won the best film award this year. They have also received attention from many well-known animated film companies.
