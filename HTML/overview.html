            <section class="longp">
                <p>In the long-term activity, children will live on the island for at least a year. They will be exposed to the three areas(artificial intelligence, movie, and music industries) at the beginning. As we analyze their reactions to the activities, they will involve in a particular area that they are interested in.<br><br>Besides, we will also provide a school education tailored to each child. The purpose of the long-term activity is to enhance the children's ability to control their concentration and then let
                     them slowly use this ability in other relatively unattractive areas(such as studying). Of course, these three are just big categories, and there will be more detailed subcategories for the children to choose from, which will not be elaborated here.<br><br>According to our former researches, the long-term activity will be more efficient and have a better result than medical treatment for 96.87% of cases.<br><br>
                     For safety concerns, every child will be well protected. Before they participate in any activity, we will rule out all the possible dangers at the very beginning.
                    Furthermore, We will also invite an authoritative third party organization to inspect us anytime at anyplace.<br><br>If parents are still not at ease, we welcome parents to live with the children in this city.<br><br>
                    Note: All activities provided are <em>Free</em>(including food, accommodation, education...and so on).

                <h1 class="shortp">Short-term Activity</h1>
                <section class="shortp">
                    <p>The short-term version is for children to participate in activities in our city during their summer or winter vacation. Due to the restriction of participation time,  children cannot involve in any relevant part of the creation.<br><br>
                        This part of the consideration is that creative activities usually take a long time, and this will have no effect on their ability to control concentration if children can't see the results in the summer and winter vacations. Therefore, they can only participate in film performances.<br><br>
                        Although short-term programs do not treat ADHD as thoroughly as long-term activities, according to our analysis and predictions, this approach allows 98% of cases to have an improvement of entering the state of “concentration”.<br><br>
                        Also, after short-term activities, we recommend that parents can take their children to a general hospital for treatment with or without drugs. This two-pronged approach can achieve a similar result from long-term activities.<br><br>

                        The safety protection will be done as thoroughly as the long-term version. Again, parents are welcomed to the island.<br><br>

                        Note: All activities provided are <em>Free</em>(including food, accommodation, education...and so on).

                <section class="cooperationp">
                    <p>For us, the children's creations are invaluable, and their ownership of the works belongs to them. Of course, we can provide places to help children saving their works. It is totally fine if children want to bring their work back, but we will keep a copy as a memorial.<br><br>
                        As mentioned before, every child's work may take someones' fancy. In this part, we will also play the role of a middleman, trying to promote cooperation with two sides. The purpose of this is to let the world know about ADHD children and children can receive a good reward from their hard work.<br><br>
                        Note: We will not charge any money from children and parents.
